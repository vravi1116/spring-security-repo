#In this example we are covering Spring Security

Note :
to access the template file like html you need to add
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
      <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-thymeleaf</artifactId>
    </dependency>
 in pom.xml which help to process the dynamic + template file processing

 Now we are able to access the page all the endpoint in through browser or postman
 ##ref: Spring-Security-Examples.postman_collection.json

##Once you add the spring-sercurity-starter in pom
you will not be able to access any page you will be routed to login page if you are accessing through web-browser

if you are using post-man you will be getting Un-authorized 401

Note : Similar to 403 Forbidden, but specifically for use when authentication is possible but
has failed or not yet been provided. The response must include a WWW-Authenticate header field
containing a challenge applicable to the requested resource.

now spring will ask to login :
so you can input below details

username as ::user
and password as :: 96cf5aed-69b9-4509-8d94-5345fb3575b1

this password will be generated by spring you can see in the log

search below line
Using generated security password
